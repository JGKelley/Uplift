    <h1>Positive thinking: Stop negative self-talk to reduce stress</h1>
    Positive thinking helps with stress management and can even improve your health. Practice overcoming negative
    self-talk with examples provided.

    By Mayo Clinic Staff
    Is your glass half-empty or half-full? How you answer this age-old question about positive thinking may reflect your
    outlook on life, your attitude toward yourself, and whether you're optimistic or pessimistic — and it may even
    affect
    your health.

    Indeed, some studies show that personality traits such as optimism and pessimism can affect many areas of your
    health
    and well-being. The positive thinking that usually comes with optimism is a key part of effective stress management.
    And
    effective stress management is associated with many health benefits. If you tend to be pessimistic, don't despair —
    you
    can learn positive thinking skills.

    <h2>Understanding positive thinking and self-talk</h2>
    Positive thinking doesn't mean that you keep your head in the sand and ignore life's less pleasant situations.
    Positive
    thinking just means that you approach unpleasantness in a more positive and productive way. You think the best is
    going
    to happen, not the worst.

    Positive thinking often starts with self-talk. Self-talk is the endless stream of unspoken thoughts that run through
    your head. These automatic thoughts can be positive or negative. Some of your self-talk comes from logic and reason.
    Other self-talk may arise from misconceptions that you create because of lack of information.

    If the thoughts that run through your head are mostly negative, your outlook on life is more likely pessimistic. If
    your
    thoughts are mostly positive, you're likely an optimist — someone who practices positive thinking.

    <h2>The health benefits of positive thinking</h2>
    Researchers continue to explore the effects of positive thinking and optimism on health. Health benefits that
    positive thinking may provide include:

    Increased life span
    Lower rates of depression
    Lower levels of distress
    Greater resistance to the common cold
    Better psychological and physical well-being
    Better cardiovascular health and reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease
    Better coping skills during hardships and times of stress
    It's unclear why people who engage in positive thinking experience these health benefits. One theory is that having
    a
    positive outlook enables you to cope better with stressful situations, which reduces the harmful health effects of
    stress on your body.

    It's also thought that positive and optimistic people tend to live healthier lifestyles — they get more physical
    activity, follow a healthier diet, and don't smoke or drink alcohol in excess.

    <h2>Identifying negative thinking</h2>
    Not sure if your self-talk is positive or negative? Some common forms of negative self-talk include:

    Filtering. You magnify the negative aspects of a situation and filter out all of the positive ones. For example, you
    had
    a great day at work. You completed your tasks ahead of time and were complimented for doing a speedy and thorough
    job.
    That evening, you focus only on your plan to do even more tasks and forget about the compliments you received.
    Personalizing. When something bad occurs, you automatically blame yourself. For example, you hear that an evening
    out
    with friends is canceled, and you assume that the change in plans is because no one wanted to be around you.
    Catastrophizing. You automatically anticipate the worst. The drive-through coffee shop gets your order wrong and you
    automatically think that the rest of your day will be a disaster.
    Polarizing. You see things only as either good or bad. There is no middle ground. You feel that you have to be
    perfect
    or you're a total failure.

    <h2>Focusing on positive thinking</h2>
    You can learn to turn negative thinking into positive thinking. The process is simple, but it does take time and
    practice — you're creating a new habit, after all. Here are some ways to think and behave in a more positive and
    optimistic way:

    Identify areas to change. If you want to become more optimistic and engage in more positive thinking, first identify
    areas of your life that you usually think negatively about, whether it's work, your daily commute or a relationship.
    You
    can start small by focusing on one area to approach in a more positive way.
    Check yourself. Periodically during the day, stop and evaluate what you're thinking. If you find that your thoughts
    are
    mainly negative, try to find a way to put a positive spin on them.
    Be open to humor. Give yourself permission to smile or laugh, especially during difficult times. Seek humor in
    everyday
    happenings. When you can laugh at life, you feel less stressed.
    Follow a healthy lifestyle. Aim to exercise for about 30 minutes on most days of the week. You can also break it up
    into
    10-minute chunks of time during the day. Exercise can positively affect mood and reduce stress. Follow a healthy
    diet to
    fuel your mind and body. And learn techniques to manage stress.
    Surround yourself with positive people. Make sure those in your life are positive, supportive people you can depend
    on
    to give helpful advice and feedback. Negative people may increase your stress level and make you doubt your ability
    to
    manage stress in healthy ways.
    Practice positive self-talk. Start by following one simple rule: Don't say anything to yourself that you wouldn't
    say to
    anyone else. Be gentle and encouraging with yourself. If a negative thought enters your mind, evaluate it rationally
    and
    respond with affirmations of what is good about you. Think about things you're thankful for in your life.
    Here are some examples of negative self-talk and how you can apply a positive thinking twist to them:

    Putting positive thinking into practice
    Negative self-talk Positive thinking
    I've never done it before. It's an opportunity to learn something new.
    It's too complicated. I'll tackle it from a different angle.
    I don't have the resources. Necessity is the mother of invention.
    I'm too lazy to get this done. I wasn't able to fit it into my schedule, but I can re-examine some priorities.
    There's no way it will work. I can try to make it work.
    It's too radical a change. Let's take a chance.
    No one bothers to communicate with me. I'll see if I can open the channels of communication.
    I'm not going to get any better at this. I'll give it another try.

    <h2>Practicing positive thinking every day</h2>
    If you tend to have a negative outlook, don't expect to become an optimist overnight. But with practice, eventually
    your
    self-talk will contain less self-criticism and more self-acceptance. You may also become less critical of the world
    around you.

    When your state of mind is generally optimistic, you're better able to handle everyday stress in a more constructive
    way. That ability may contribute to the widely observed health benefits of positive thinking.
